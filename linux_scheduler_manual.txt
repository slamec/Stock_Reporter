Well the issue was pretty dumb, I did run pip install python-dotenv and sudo pip install python-dotenv (the script need root permission to access some folder) but I didn't do sudo -H pip install python-dotenv.

this should be installed 

folder should be in computer not in mnt directory

do not forger chmod +x filename
